# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is my first React project and it is based on the react tutorial at https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html.

Features to be added (suggested in the tutorial):
- **Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list. (Added)**
- **Bold the currently selected item in the move list. (Added)**
- **Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them. (Added)**
- **Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order. (Added)**
- **When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win. (Added)**
- **When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw. (Added)**
